	\subsection{High level architecture}
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\caption{High level architecture}
			\label{fig:HighLevelArchitecture}
		\end{figure}
		As displayed in \cref{fig:HighLevelArchitecture}, the system embraces the MVC architectural pattern (see \cref{sec:Patterns}) and can be divided into 5 subsystems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Storage:} 
				The Storage subsystem is responsible of encoding and persist the data needed by the system. 
				As the system even embraces the REST pattern, this is the only subsystem that stores data. 
				This subsystem is only composed by the Database Management System. This subsystem coincides with the Model subsystem.
			\item \textbf{Data manipulation:} 
				This is the main Controller subsystem. 
				Its components are responsible to handle the User's requests, recive data (and forward them to the Storage), and in general to cover the functional 
				sides of the system.
			\item \textbf{Security:} 
				The Security subsystem is an auxiliary controller. It will grant Authentication functionalities to the system, but plays no role in fullfilling
				funcitonal requirements.
			\item \textbf{Presentation:}
				This subsystem is responsible of displaying the outputs of the Data Manipulation subsystem in a way appreciable by an average user. 
				It takes care of the presentation for both authorities (exploiting HTML pages) and citizens (exploiting the GUI of the mobile application).
			\item \textbf{Interface:}
				This subsystem manages the communication between the server(s) and the clients. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests for both webpages and
				raw resources (used later by the mobile application), and of sending emails as well. In a typical working scenario, the previous subsystems are
				activated by this one, which forwards user requests.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Data model} The system's data will be stored in a cloud-based relational database. The Entity-Relationship diagram in \cref{fig:DataModel} explains which data the system will store and manage. In detail, the database will contain the following tables:

	The following list provides a detailed description of each module's functionalities (calls to components are omitted here as they will be
	datailed in sequence diagrams):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \label{component:AuthenticationManager} \textbf{AuthenticationManager:}
			This module will authenticate the user comparing the provided credentials with the ones stored to the database, and if a match is found
			will generate a session token for authentication. The provided password will be hashed before comparison (as passwords won't be stored
			in plain text). The usage of a token (nounce) can prevent many malicious attacks, such as 
		 	\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery}{Csrf attacks} or 
			\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack}{Replay attacks}. 
		 \item \label{component:SignupController} \textbf{SignupController:} 
		 	This component will manage the signup procedure, in particular it's main functionalities will be: reciving a signup request, check the
		 	constraints of the provided data (in example, unicity of username and email, strength of the password), hash the password, temporary store these data, 
		 	generate and send a token to the given email to verify it, persistently store the data. The email validation can provide some protection against
		 	\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack}{DoS attacks}, but full protection is
		 	currently unachievable (many researches are running to find a solution)
		 \item \label{component:EncryptionService} \textbf{EncryptionService:}
		 	\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt}{BCrypt}
		 \item \label{component:HtmlServer} \textbf{HtmlServer:}
		 	This component is an interface to handle \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol}{http} requests for the HTML pages to be displayed
		 	on a web browser. 
		 \item \label{component:MailServer} \textbf{MailServer:} 
		 	This component is an interface for mail sending emails to the users, in particular notifications (i.e: a ticket has been issued to them) and the first email
		 	used to confirm the email address.
		 \item \label{component:RestApi} \textbf{RestApi:} 
		 	This component will handle the custom messaging protocol with Citizen's devices. The communication will rely on HTTPS, in order to protect the system from 
		 	\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack}{Man in the Middle attacks}.
		 \item \label{component:JSP} \textbf{\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages}{JSP:}}
		 	This component, relying on a well-known technology, will dynamically create HTML data starting from given templates and data.
		 \item \label{component:NotificationManager} \textbf{NotificationManager:}
		 	This component will decide when is needed to send a notification to an User, by sending an email in case of Authorities, or by displaying a notification 
		 	on the application and/or sending an email in case of Citizens, according to the preferences they setted.
		 \item \label{component:MapBuilder} \textbf{MapBuilder:}
		 	This component is responsible to aggregate data from the database according to a geographical location, and to create the data needed to display them
		 	using the Google Maps API.
		 \item \label{component:TopViolatorsRankingBuilder} \textbf{TopViolatorsRankingBuilder:}
		 	This component will query the database for Violations based on a geographical location, hide the plate from pictures and
		 	generate the list for the Top Violators page.
		 \item \label{component:ComputerVisionEngine} \textbf{ComponentVisionEngine:}
		 	The main functionality of this component is to recive a picture and extract the car plate out of it.
		 	It will also be used to hide the plates from the TopViolatorsRanking.
		 \item \label{component:DataMiningEngine} \textbf{DataMiningEngine:}
		 	This component will run data mining algorithms on the database to discover relevant informations with regard to specific geographical
		 	locations.
		 \item \label{component:TicketManager} \textbf{TicketManager:}
		 	This component will filter incoming notifications in order to avoid to store non-ticketable violations, and provide stored violations that are
		 	issuable on demand.
		 \item \label{component:CameraManager} \textbf{CameraManager:}
		 	This component will grant secure access to the camera of a Citizen's device, preventing it from notifying violations if the camera is not 
		 	available (for hardware fault or denied permission).
		 \item \label{component:GPSManager} \textbf{GPSManager:}
		 	This component will regulate the access to the GPS of the citizen device, as well as the gathering of the position.
		 \item \label{component:CurrentTimeManager} \textbf{CurrentTimeManager:}
		 	This component will check if the date and time settings on the user device are set to auto (the device synchronizes it's clock using 
		 	internet or the GPS). If they are, the current time is collected, otherwise the notification is blocked until the settings are changed
		 \item \label{component:DBMS} \textbf{DBMS:}
		 	This component will be respopnsible of managing the database.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Deployment view} 
	Designing the system, our main focuses were costs (both initial and maintenance) and complexity (of the system architecture and of the development).
	For this reason, we decided to put as many components on the cloud, relying on well-known and trusted providers (Amazon and Google). The final hardware system will so be composed by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Android devices: used by Citizens to interface with the system.
		\item iOs devices: used by Citizens to interface with the system. We needed to distinguish between the two kind of devices because of the possible differences in the development of the Mobile Application for different operative systems.
		\item Personal Computers: used by Authorities to interface with the system.
		\item Web Server: a replicated device used to hande HTTP requests.
		\item HTML Server: a replicated device used to generate dynamic HTML pages. We are planning to merge this first two servers in a following version of this document.
		\item Data Analysis Server: this replicated device will handle the heavy load of the computation, covering a big portion of the Data Manipulation subsystem.
	\end{itemize}
	In \cref{fig:Deployment} summarizes the datails of the deployment, highlighting the hardware, the operative systems, the running software and the resources available in the different hardwares.

	\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns} \label{sec:Patterns}
		\subsubsection{REST paradigm}
			We decided to design the system following the REpresentational State Transfer paradigm, 				in order to reduce the design complexity and improve reusability and maintainability.
			Following are stated the key concepts of REST and how they're 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Client-server architecture}
				\item \textbf{Stateless:} 
					The components does not store information of what they are doing. Every request comes with all the needed data to
					provide a response, or any missing data can be retrieved from the database or by transforming the already available
					data.
				\item \textbf{Cacheability:} 
					All the responses are marked as cacheable or not (if a response can be cached, overall 
					latency can be significantly reduced)
				\item \textbf{Layered:} 
					As pointed in \cref{somewhere}, the system is organized in layers and provide
					interfaces to external processes (controlled by users or automated=
				\item \textbf{Uniform interface:} 
					Uniformity of the interface is granded by exposing HTTP endpoints, which transmit resources using
					the \link{https://json.org/json-en.html}{JSON} format.
					\subitem \textbf{Resource identification:} 
						Evevry data exposed to the outside and not representational (Webpages) is 
						encoded in the JSON format. Web pages are obviously provided in 
						\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML}{HTML} format, in order to be displayable by
						common web browsers.
					\subitem \textbf{Resource manipulation through representations:}
						The format of the resources can be easly modified, as are represented
						in a structured text format
					\subitem \textbf{Self-descriptive messages:}
						The JSON format names every data exchanged. The names we use are
						expressive enought to be self-descriptive
					\subitem \textbf{Hypermedia as the engine of application state:}
						Concerning the API, we provide a service broker to expose all of the
						interface mathods. With regard to the web application, it's navigable 
						using web links (see \cref{fig:homepage})
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{MVC pattern}
			The \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller}{Model, View, Controller} pattern is a widely 
			used pattern. Its main advantage is a significant reduction of the complexity, granted by a layered
			structure that subdivides responsibilities.

First, each component has been prioritized for both value generated for each user-type and implementation difficulty. The results of this prioritization are displayed in the \cref{tab:developPriorities}. For cloud-placed and bought components, the expected price and the configuration effort for the chosen implementation are both written in parenthesis. Empty cells indicate components not significant for that type of user. Finally, components fullfilled by the same service (cloud-based or bought) are not separated by horizontal lines.

Analyzing the table, we indentified 5 implementation phases: Prototype, Basic Logic, Authentication, Mobile Security, Extended features. In \cref{tab:developPhases} describes, for each phase, which component are to develop in that phase, how it's planned to develop them, their estimated effort and the estimate effort of the phase. Finally, \cref{fig:developmentPriorities} shows which phases must happen before and which later (note that some may be performed in parallel).

\paragraph{Unit testing}For testing, we have to assume that every outsourced solution has been tested and is perfectly working (as we can't perform unit testing on them). With regard to the Mobile Application, the Ticket Manager, the Data Mining Engine, the Notification Manager and the Top Violators Ranking Builder, a set of tests will be generated before the beginning of the coding phase in order to guide it, and to define some initial acceptance criteria. More precise tests will be developed during the coding phase, in order to test the coponent behaviour more in detail.

\paragraph{Integration testing} Into each phase, integration testing will be performed to integrate components of the same phase one with the other and with the pre-existing system (assumed to be working perfectly and already tested exhaustively).
