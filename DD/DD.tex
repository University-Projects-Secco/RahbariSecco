\section{Architectural Design}
	\subsection{Overview} High-level components and their interaction
	\subsection{Component view}
	\subsection{Deployment view}
	\subsection{Runtime view}	You	can	use	sequence	diagrams	to	describe	the	way	components	interact

already	done,	possibly,	providing	here	some	extensions	if	applicable.
\section{Requirement traceability}	Explain	how	the	requirements	you	have	defined	in	the	RASD

\section{Implementation, Integration and Test plan}	Identify	here	the	order	in	which	you	plan	
to	implement	the	subcomponents	of	your	system	and	the	order	in	which	you	plan	to	integrate
